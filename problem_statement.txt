# MOM from Problem statement regarding call
1- we just need to convert audio to text and then speaker will reply based on patient question.

2- No need use any hardware or any model just need to utilise the labelled data and need to input this categories into speaker or device.

3- other verbal conversation between speaker and patient no involvement of doctor

4- Data should be reliable and stored in databases.

5- We just need to create prototype and fix the variables hardcoded based on general specifications and daily routine checkup .

6- The speaker will not suggest the prescriptions and doctor will check the patients response after the conversation.
